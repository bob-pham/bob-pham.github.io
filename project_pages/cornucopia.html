        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>Cornucopia is intended to be an app which scans user grocery reciepts to help manager kitchen pantries and minimize food waste</p>
        <h3>Development/Implementation</h3>
        <p>As mentioned above, Cornucopia scans user grocery receipts and indexes products. This is accomplished using the OpenCV library, with text recognition being done using PyTesseract. The OpenCV library is primarily used to work with the image, where it is compressed and converted to be monochromatic for faster PyTesseract reads. Additionally, excess whitespace is cropped by searching for and keeping the area with high black-pixel density. The text that PyTessesract outputs are then filtered using a combination of Python functions mutating strings and Regex. Data is parsed into relevant objects once all irrelevant information is removed, to be stored in an SQL database that is currently being developed.</p>
        <p>Cornucopia is being developed using test-driven development. To test the accuracy of reading and filtering text, I created a custom unit testing framework on top of Python's unittest. The framework tests the text by comparing what is read and filtered with what the tester provides in a .txt document. The tester provides an accuracy score, and if the score calculated by the framework is lower than the provided score, the test fails. Accuracy is determined by looking at the differences in frequency of the characters that appear in the document and sentence structure. Finally, in order to easily see where the descrepencies originate from, the framework generates a seperate .txt files with the descrepencies highlighted.</p>
        <p>A web scraper is currently being developed to find product recalls. These would then be put into a database, which can be searched through to determine if any user products have been recalled. This has been generally supersceded by simply calling the FDA/Inspection Canada API's, but the webscraper is still useful for other aggregate platforms.  </p>
        <p>The front-end is currently being made using JavaScript and React/React Native, however, the most of the focus is still on the backend, where the Django Framework is being used.</p>
