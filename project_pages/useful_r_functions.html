        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>A collection of R functions that make certain calculations simpler. Built on top of pre-existing R functions. Copy + Paste into RStudio or similar. (File on GitHub link Above)</p>
        <p>Functions For Calculating:</p>
        <p> - Standard Error for Sample Proportions/Means/Independent Groups</p>
        <p> - Test Statistic for Sample Proportions/Means (unknown SD)/Independent Groups/Dependent Groups</p>
        <p> - Test Statistic for Analysis of Variance</p>
        <p> - Confidence intervals for Sample Proportion (with + without SE)</p>
        <p> - Confidence intervals for Sample Means (with + without SE, known/unknown population SD)</p>
        <p> - Confidence intervals for Independent Groups </p>
        <p> - Margin of Error (from Confidence Level)</p>
        <p> - Minimum Sample size given margin of error</p>
        <p> - Regression Line Model Slope + Intercepts</p>
        <h3>Development/Implementation</h3>
        <p>These were developed as I found certain calculations tedious, with no simpler way of calculating them with R, or in-built R calcuations gave excess superfluous information. Since I was already using R as a tool in many of these calcuations, I wrote these functions to automate the entire calcuations.</p>
