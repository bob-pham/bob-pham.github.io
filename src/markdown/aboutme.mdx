Hello! I'm Bob.

\
I am a third-year honours computer science student at the University of British Columbia. Currently, I am a firmware engineer intern at Intel, as part of the Ethernet Products Group (EPG), working on firmware security. I am passionate about programming and am continually striving to push my abilities to the next level, understand new technologies, and learn industry practices.

I am currently interested in internship opportunities for summer 2023. Message me for all inquiries and/or if you're interested in working together on a project!
